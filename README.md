# Polylinguist (Android)

Android app for Polylinguist. Work in progress.

**Note**: not a general use application for any given Github profile, it has been hardcoded to [Polylinguist API](https://github.com/stscoundrel/polylinguist) tied to my Github account. To use it for your own, you'd have to clone & setup your own [Polylinguist instance](https://github.com/stscoundrel/polylinguist-vercel) and fork this app & change the main address. It is mostly a personal toy project.
